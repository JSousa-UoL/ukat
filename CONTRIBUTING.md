*(This document is work-in-progress)*

# TLDR
- Document all code (`numpy` [format](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html))
- Ensure code follows [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Provide tests
- Ideally, provide examples and/or tutorials

# Documentation
Code with bad/non-existent documentation will become useless sooner or later. All modules/classes/functions should be documented following the `numpy` docstring guide ([format](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html), [example](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html#example))

# Code style
Ensure your code style follows the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standard. This ensures readability and consistency across the entire repository. This task can be made very easy by configuring your code editor to automatically check for [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliance (most modern editors can do this).

# Tests
*To do*

# Examples/tutorials
We should strive to have examples/tutorials for the main methods implemented in this repository. Ideally in jupyter notebook format (`.ipynb` files) in the `tutorials` directory.
