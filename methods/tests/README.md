This directory should contain test scripts for all code in the `methods` directory.

Name scripts as `tests_<name-of-module-being-tested>.py`. For example, if we're testing a module in `methods` named `t2star.py`, this directory should contain a test script named `tests_t2star.py`. This is the method used by the dipy group (see [here](https://github.com/dipy/dipy/tree/master/dipy/core/tests) for their tests for the core module).
