# `tutorials` directory
This directory should contain jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) providing tutorials on how to use code from the `methods` directory.

## File outputs from tutorials
If a tutorial generates file outputs, please ensure the outputs are saved in a specific directory for each tutorial which should be named `<tutorial_name>_output`. For example, the outputs of the `t2star_calculation` tutorial should be saved in a directory named `t2star_calculation_output`.
