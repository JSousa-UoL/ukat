# Information about Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) data

## Temporal SNR (tSNR) Data

### Philips-specific information
* `tsnr_high_philips`: contains a FAIR ASL dataset collected as part of the 2021 traveling kidney study in nottingham on 06/16/2021. This dataset has a relatively high tSNR.
* `tsnr_high_philips`: contains a FAIR ASL dataset collected as part of a different study, hence the different FOV. This dataset had a low tSNR, additional Gaussian noise was added to further reduce the tSNR.
