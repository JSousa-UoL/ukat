# Information about segmentation data

## Network weights

* `segmentation/total_kidney_weights`: weights for the convolutional neural network used to segment the kidneys from T2-weighted HASTE images in [Daniel et al (MRM, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28768)

## Philips-specific information

* `segmentation/philips_t1w` : T1-weighted GRE scan designed to optimise cortical/medullary contrast collected on a Philips system
* `segmentation/philips_t2w` : T2-weighted HASTE scan designed to optimise contrast between the kidneys and surrounding tissue collected on a Philips system
